\textbf{Project Report}: The report of this project.  
\textbf{Seismic Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}: A Jupyter Notebook, contains all the majority of code and instructions.  
\textbf{helper}: A python file, contains the helper functions for this project.  
\textbf{Models}: Models trained in this project. Only 5 of 7 models are there because the other two models are to big to be uploaded.  
\textbf{Coordinates + Labels}: The training coordinates and labels data used in this project. Can be used directly to save training time.  
  
To be noticed, the \textbf{data} is not included in the repository because all rights of the data are belonged to Perenco Oil & Gas. Please contact me personally to get access to the data through hard drive.
